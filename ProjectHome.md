If you just want to get the Unity3D project with ready-made binaries, go [here](Unity3DProject.md). You might need Unity3D 3.4.1, and you'll certainly need Unity3D Pro (on account of the native code plugin).

If you want to build the plugin yourself, go [here](Building.md).

Some [implementation notes](ImplementationNotes.md).
